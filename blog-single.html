        <p>
          A good warm-up can make or break your session. It prepares your muscles, joints, and nervous system for the
          work ahead — yet most people either skip it entirely or do it wrong. Here are five of the most common warm-up
          mistakes and what to do instead.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Skipping it altogether</h2>
        <p>
          We get it — you're short on time and want to jump straight into the main workout. But diving into heavy lifts
          or high-intensity intervals without warming up increases your risk of injury and reduces performance. Even five
          minutes of targeted movement makes a difference.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Static stretching before training</h2>
        <p>
          Holding long stretches before exercise can actually reduce power output and muscle activation. Save static
          stretching for after your session. Instead, use dynamic movements like leg swings, arm circles, and walking
          lunges to increase blood flow and range of motion.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Doing the same warm-up every time</h2>
        <p>
          Your warm-up should match the session ahead. A lower-body strength day needs hip and ankle prep, while an
          upper-body session calls for shoulder and thoracic mobility. A generic five-minute jog on the treadmill won't
          cut it for every workout.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Rushing through it</h2>
        <p>
          A warm-up isn't just a box to tick. Moving too quickly through the motions means your body doesn't have time
          to respond. Slow down, focus on the quality of each movement, and give your joints time to open up.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Ignoring your weak spots</h2>
        <p>
          If you know your hips are tight or your shoulders are stiff, your warm-up is the perfect time to address it.
          Adding a few targeted activation exercises — like banded glute bridges or wall slides — can improve your
          movement quality for the entire session.
        </p>

        <h2>The takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          A warm-up doesn't need to be long, but it does need to be intentional. Match it to your session, move with
          purpose, and treat it as part of your training — not something separate from it.
        </p>
